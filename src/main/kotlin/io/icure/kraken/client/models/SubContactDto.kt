/**
 * This entity represents a sub-contact. It is serialized in JSON and saved in the underlying icure-contact CouchDB database.
 * @param tags A tag is an item from a codification system that qualifies an entity as being member of a certain class, whatever the value it might have taken. If the tag qualifies the content of a field, it means that whatever the content of the field, the tag will always apply. For example, the label of a field is qualified using a tag. LOINC is a codification system typically used for tags.
 * @param codes A code is an item from a codification system that qualifies the content of this entity. SNOMED-CT, ICPC-2 or ICD-10 codifications systems can be used for codes
 * @param services List of all services provided to the patient under a given contact which is linked by this sub-contact to other structuring elements.
 * @param id The Id of the sub-contact. We encourage using either a v4 UUID or a HL7 Id.
 * @param created The timestamp (unix epoch in ms) of creation of this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param modified The date (unix epoch in ms) of the latest modification of this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param author The id of the User that has created this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param responsible The id of the HealthcareParty that is responsible for this entity, will be filled automatically if missing. Not enforced by the application server.
 * @param medicalLocationId The id of the medical location where this entity was created.
 * @param endOfLife Soft delete (unix epoch in ms) timestamp of the object.
 * @param descr Description of the sub-contact
 * @param protocol Protocol based on which the sub-contact was used for linking services to structuring elements
 * @param status 
 * @param formId Id of the form used in the sub-contact. Several sub-contacts with the same form ID can coexist as long as they are in different contacts or they relate to a different planOfActionID
 * @param planOfActionId Id of the plan of action (healthcare approach) that is linked by the sub-contact to a service.
 * @param healthElementId Id of the healthcare element that is linked by the sub-contact to a service
 * @param classificationId 
 * @param encryptedSelf The base64 encoded data of this object, formatted as JSON and encrypted in AES using the random master key from encryptionKeys.
